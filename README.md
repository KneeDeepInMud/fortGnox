# fortGnox
Java based password manager front-end on top of GPG

## What is **fortGnox**

__fortGnox__ is a GUI password manager written in Java. It is based on [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/) which is used as backend for all encryption related tasks.

Motivation was the long year usage of command line password manager [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) which can be used in friendly coexistence together with __fortGnox__ on the same password store.

Although __fortKnox__ was mainly developed under Linux, it is already used by people around the globe also under Windows (well ... maybe not the globe ... at least I know of a handful of people using it).

## Features ##
- Password management (creation / random generation).
- Keybordless usage of passwords through the clipboard. The passwords are flushed from clipboard after a timeout.
- Passwords are masked in the GUI. This allows usage of __fortGnox__ even if other people are around.
- Integrates smoothly with [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)

## Requirements ##

- Java 8 (or later)
- [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/)
- Some courage to face the manual configuration (for the time being).


## Installation ##

TBD
